        ## ðŸ”Œ Issue Description
        
        Create a foundation for a plugin system that will allow users to extend Wooak's functionality with custom features.
        
        **Current Issue:**
        - No plugin system exists
        - Limited extensibility
        - No way for users to add custom functionality
        - Hard to add new features without modifying core code
        
        **Expected Solution:**
        - Design plugin system architecture
        - Implement basic plugin interface
        - Add plugin discovery mechanism
        - Create example plugins
        
        **Files to Modify:**
        - Create `internal/core/plugins/` package
        - Add plugin interfaces and types
        - Create example plugins
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] Design plugin architecture
        - [ ] Implement plugin interface
        - [ ] Add plugin discovery
        - [ ] Create example plugins
        - [ ] Add plugin documentation
        - [ ] Add plugin tests
        
        **Difficulty:** High
        **Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours
        
        ## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Details
        
        This issue involves creating a comprehensive plugin system:
        
        **Plugin system components:**
        1. **Plugin interface** - Define plugin contract and lifecycle
        2. **Plugin manager** - Load, unload, and manage plugins
        3. **Plugin discovery** - Find and load plugins from filesystem
        4. **Plugin communication** - Event system for plugin interaction
        5. **Plugin configuration** - Configuration management for plugins
        
        **Suggested Approach:**
        1. Design plugin architecture and interfaces
        2. Implement plugin manager and lifecycle
        3. Add plugin discovery mechanism
        4. Create event system for plugin communication
        5. Build example plugins (VPN, proxy, custom AI providers)
        
        **Plugin types to support:**
        - Connection plugins (VPN, proxy, jump hosts)
        - Authentication plugins (2FA, biometrics)
        - AI provider plugins (custom AI services)
        - UI plugins (custom panels, themes)
        - Integration plugins (cloud providers, monitoring)
