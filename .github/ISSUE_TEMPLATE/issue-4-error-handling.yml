        ## üõ†Ô∏è Issue Description
        
        Some TUI components could provide better error handling and user feedback, especially during network operations and file operations.
        
        **Current Issue:**
        - Limited error feedback in some UI components
        - Network timeouts not handled gracefully
        - File operation errors could be more user-friendly
        - No loading indicators for long operations
        
        **Expected Solution:**
        - Add better error messages and user feedback
        - Implement graceful handling of network timeouts
        - Add loading indicators for long operations
        - Improve error recovery mechanisms
        
        **Files to Modify:**
        - `internal/adapters/ui/handlers.go`
        - `internal/adapters/ui/server_form.go`
        - `internal/adapters/ui/tui.go`
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
        - [ ] Implement user-friendly error messages
        - [ ] Add loading indicators
        - [ ] Handle network timeouts gracefully
        - [ ] Add error recovery options
        - [ ] Update UI documentation
        
        **Difficulty:** Medium
        **Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours
        
        ## üéØ Technical Details
        
        The issue affects several UI components where error handling could be improved:
        
        **Areas to improve:**
        1. **Network operations** - SSH connections, AI requests
        2. **File operations** - Config file reading/writing
        3. **User input validation** - Better error messages
        4. **Long-running operations** - Progress indicators
        
        **Suggested Approach:**
        1. Create a centralized error handling system
        2. Add user-friendly error messages
        3. Implement loading indicators using tview components
        4. Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
        5. Create error recovery dialogs
        
        **UI Components to enhance:**
        - Error modals with better messaging
        - Loading spinners for long operations
        - Progress bars for file operations
        - Retry buttons for failed operations
