        ## ðŸ§ª Issue Description
        
        Some critical components have insufficient test coverage, particularly in error handling and edge cases.
        
        **Current Issue:**
        - Missing tests for error scenarios
        - Limited edge case testing
        - Some components lack comprehensive test coverage
        - Integration tests are minimal
        
        **Expected Solution:**
        - Add tests for error handling scenarios
        - Implement edge case testing
        - Add integration tests for critical workflows
        - Improve test coverage metrics
        
        **Files to Modify:**
        - Add tests for `internal/adapters/data/ssh_config_file/`
        - Add tests for `internal/core/services/security/`
        - Add integration tests
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] Add error scenario tests
        - [ ] Implement edge case testing
        - [ ] Add integration tests
        - [ ] Achieve >80% test coverage
        - [ ] Add performance tests
        - [ ] Update test documentation
        
        **Difficulty:** Medium
        **Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours
        
        ## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Details
        
        This issue focuses on improving test coverage in several key areas:
        
        **Areas needing better test coverage:**
        1. **Error handling scenarios** - Network failures, file I/O errors, validation failures
        2. **Edge cases** - Empty inputs, malformed data, boundary conditions
        3. **Integration tests** - End-to-end workflows, component interactions
        4. **Security tests** - Input validation, file permissions, audit logging
        
        **Suggested Approach:**
        1. Analyze current test coverage using `go test -cover`
        2. Identify components with low coverage
        3. Add table-driven tests for error scenarios
        4. Implement integration tests for critical workflows
        5. Add performance benchmarks
        
        **Test types to add:**
        - Unit tests for error handling
        - Integration tests for workflows
        - Performance benchmarks
        - Security-focused tests
        - Concurrency tests
