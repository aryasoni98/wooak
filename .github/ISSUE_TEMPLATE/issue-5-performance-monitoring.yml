        ## ðŸ“Š Issue Description
        
        Add comprehensive performance monitoring and metrics collection to help identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
        
        **Current Issue:**
        - No performance metrics collection
        - Limited monitoring of application performance
        - No way to identify performance bottlenecks
        - No insights into resource usage
        
        **Expected Solution:**
        - Implement metrics collection for key operations
        - Add performance monitoring for AI requests
        - Monitor file I/O operations
        - Add memory and CPU usage tracking
        
        **Files to Modify:**
        - `internal/core/services/monitoring/metrics.go`
        - `internal/core/services/monitoring/monitoring_service.go`
        - Add metrics collection throughout the application
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] Implement metrics collection
        - [ ] Add performance monitoring
        - [ ] Monitor AI request performance
        - [ ] Track file I/O operations
        - [ ] Add memory/CPU monitoring
        - [ ] Create performance dashboard
        
        **Difficulty:** Medium-High
        **Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours
        
        ## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Details
        
        This issue involves implementing comprehensive performance monitoring across the application:
        
        **Metrics to implement:**
        1. **Application metrics** - Startup time, memory usage, CPU usage
        2. **AI service metrics** - Request duration, token usage, error rates
        3. **File I/O metrics** - Read/write operations, file sizes, operation duration
        4. **Network metrics** - SSH connection times, ping latency
        5. **UI metrics** - Rendering time, user interaction response time
        
        **Suggested Approach:**
        1. Create a metrics collection framework
        2. Add Prometheus-compatible metrics
        3. Implement performance counters and timers
        4. Add memory and CPU profiling
        5. Create a performance dashboard
        
        **Implementation areas:**
        - HTTP middleware for AI requests
        - File operation wrappers
        - Memory profiling hooks
        - Performance counters
