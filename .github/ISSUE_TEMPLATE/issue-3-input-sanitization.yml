        ## ðŸ”’ Issue Description
        
        Some file path inputs are not properly sanitized, which could lead to security vulnerabilities like path traversal attacks.
        
        **Current Issue:**
        - File paths in validation functions need better sanitization
        - Potential path traversal vulnerabilities
        - Missing validation for special characters and sequences
        
        **Expected Solution:**
        - Implement comprehensive path sanitization
        - Add validation for path traversal attempts
        - Sanitize special characters and sequences
        - Add security tests
        
        **Files to Modify:**
        - `internal/adapters/ui/validation.go`
        - `internal/adapters/data/ssh_config_file/file_system.go`
        - Add security-focused tests
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] Implement path sanitization functions
        - [ ] Add path traversal protection
        - [ ] Sanitize special characters
        - [ ] Add security tests
        - [ ] Update validation logic
        - [ ] Document security measures
        
        **Difficulty:** Medium
        **Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
        
        ## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Details
        
        The issue is in the validation functions, particularly around file path handling. We need to prevent attacks like:
        - `../../../etc/passwd` (path traversal)
        - `\..\..\windows\system32` (Windows path traversal)
        - Null byte injection
        - Special character manipulation
        
        **Suggested Approach:**
        1. Create a dedicated path sanitization package
        2. Implement path traversal detection
        3. Add character filtering and validation
        4. Create comprehensive security tests
        5. Add input validation for all file operations
        
        **Security Considerations:**
        - Prevent directory traversal attacks
        - Validate file extensions
        - Check for dangerous characters
        - Implement proper path normalization
